## AST Calculator

A calculator for Area of Steel for Beams in Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures.
This calculator will consider the following conditions

- When the Ultimate Design Moment is provided
- When the depth and width of the beam section is provided
- As expected, all the normal constants would be provided for questions of such nature.
e.g Fy => The Characteristic Strength of Steel, usually between 410N/mm^2 and 460N/mm^2  
    Fcu => The Characteristic Strength of Concrete would also be provided.

This calculator can be used for simple classroom calculations. Further versions will considered 'Doubly Reinforced Sections', no Ultimate Moment provided and other edge conditions.
